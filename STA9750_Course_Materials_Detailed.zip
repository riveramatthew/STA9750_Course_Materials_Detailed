# STA 9750 Course Materials Detailed Zip Folder
This zip folder contains materials for STA 9750 (Software Tools for Data Analysis) at Baruch College, CUNY, designed for RStudio. It includes .R scripts, starter datasets, and mini-project templates for a 12-week semester, based on the course description focusing on data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling using R.

## Detailed File Contents
Below are example files for three weeks (Week 1, Week 6, and Week 12) to demonstrate the structure. Other weeks follow a similar pattern, covering topics like hypothesis testing, regression, ANOVA, and time series, as per the STA 9750 course description.

## Notes
- The zip folder contains 12 subfolders (Week_01 to Week_12), each with:
  - A `.R` script with example code for the week’s topic.
  - A `datasets/` subfolder with one `.csv` file (100 rows, 3-5 variables).
  - A mini-project `.R` file with skeleton comments.
- Topics are based on STA 9750’s focus on data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling (e.g., descriptive stats, regression, repeated measures).[](https://baruch-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0947421)[](http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/courses/detail.jsp?discipline=STA)
- Datasets are synthetic but realistic for educational use.
- To use: Unzip, open RStudio, and navigate to the desired week’s folder.
- Prerequisites: R packages `tidyverse` and `lme4` (for Week 12). Install via `install.packages("tidyverse")` and `install.packages("lme4")`.
